        # This allows us to know the exact coordinates of where to place images (as defined earlier in our constants) and allows us to create a background
        # image which will always be the exact size of our Canvas.
        # We also know that since our application is 800 pixels by 640, we have 140 pixels left to function as the bottom part of our application.
        # This is where we will display our buttons for the user to interact with.
        #
        # In order to claim this space and make it usable, we will use a Frame widget:

        # Feel free to change this to suit your own preferences.
        #
        # Frame widgets behave differently to Canvas widgets when they have their sizes specified.
        # By default, a Frame widget will only be as big as it needs to be in order to hold all of its child widgets.
        # If we want to force the size when placing our Frame widget into its parent using the pack geometry manager, we need to call pack_propagate(0) on it.

        #
        # For consistency, we want the buttons to all be the same size. We achieve this by passing in the width argument of 25.
        #
        # We also define two more buttons: play_again_button and quit_button.
        # At the end of the game, these buttons will display, allowing the user to decide whether or not they wish to play another game.
        # These will also call functions defined on this class, so we pass these to the command argument.

        #
        # We pack these over to the left so that they line up side by side.
        # We also add some padding to the hit_button, which will be over on the left-hand side, to space it away from the left edge of the screen,

    #
    # The first tells the game_screen whether or not to hide the dealer's first card. During the gameplay, ' \
    # the dealer's first card will need to be face down, but when the user chooses to stick with their hand, ' \
    # 'we will flip the dealer's card face up to reveal their score.
    #
    # We may also need to call the method with a pre-calculated table state. This also happens when the user decides to stick with their hand.
    #
    # By default, the dealer's first card will be hidden and we will not have a table_state.
    #
    # If a table state was not provided, then we need to ensure we get it.
    # We call the get_table_state method from our game_state instance to generate one.

        #
        # If we are hiding the dealer's first card then we do not want to display its image. ' \
        # 'We instead replace the first element in our dealer_card_images list with the back file, which we obtain using ' \

        # Now that we have some image file locations, it's time to start drawing them onto the game_screen.
        # We begin by drawing the tabletop, which will function as our background.
        # Add the following code to our display_table method:

        # Between each draw of the screen, we will delete everything currently drawn onto our Canvas.
        # This ensures that we are only drawing what we need, and anything old will not be left over.
        # We do this using the Canvas widget's delete method and by passing the string all to instruct it to delete everything.
        # Now that we have a clean slate, we will begin by drawing the background.
        # We create a PhotoImage instance containing the tabletop.png image from our assets folder and keep a reference to it
        # as the self.tabletop_image attribute.
        #
        # The tabletop.png file can be any image which is 800 pixels wide and 500 pixels tall.
        # Our PhotoImage can now be drawn onto our game_screen. We do this using the create_image method in our Canvas.
        # The first argument to create_image is a 2-tuple of the coordinates for the center of the image. Since the image is the exact size of our Canvas,
        # we want to put the center of the image at the center of our Canvas.
        # We know they are both 800 by 500, so we pass (400, 250) as our coordinates.
        # The image to place onto the Canvas is passed to the image argument. We pass our PhotoImage instance as the value here.
        #
        # With that, we now have our background on our game_screen. The next thing we need to draw is the cards:

        # To correctly position our player's cards, we need to know which card we are drawingâ€”their first, second, third, and so on.
        # We use the enumerate function to loop over our list of player_card_images and also obtain the index each is at.
        #
        # Calculating the coordinates at which to place each card is done using our classes constants.
        #
        # Each card is initially placed at the X coordinate defined by our CARD_ORIGINAL_POSITION constant,
        # then subsequent cards will be placed a distance of 100 pixels (as defined by CARD_WIDTH_OFFSET) to the right of this.
        # We get these numbers by multiplying the list index of the card we are looking to place by the CARD_WIDTH_OFFSET constant and adding
        # the result to the CARD_ORIGINAL_POSITION value.
        #
        # The Y value of our card's coordinates is always going to be the same as the number we have stored in PLAYER_CARD_HEIGHT,
        # since that defines how close to the bottom of the game_screen to draw our cards, and we always want them to line up horizontally.
        #
        # We apply the same logic when placing the dealer's card images, except we use our DEALER_CARD_HEIGHT constant to set the Y coordinate.

        # Now that the player can see their cards, we should show their score as well so that they do not have to tally their total in their head:

        #
        # The first argument to this method is once again the coordinates as a 2-tuple.
        # We have these defined as a constant, PLAYER_SCORE_TEXT_COORDS, so we use that as the first argument.
        #
        # The text argument controls what the text drawn to the screen actually says.
        # We have the score as a string available in our game_state instance, so we can call this method and use the result as the value passed.
        #
        # In order to change the font size, we can use the font argument.
        # The font argument takes a tuple. The first value in the tuple will be a string containing the font name, for example, Ariel.
        # Since we are providing None in this case, the system's default font will be used.

    # Let's look at this now:

    #   In order to unpack the hit_button and stick_button, we call the pack_forget method on them.
    #   This does not delete them but simply removes them from being displayed by the parent widget.
    #
    #   To show our play_again_button and quit_button, we pack them with the same parameters as attributed to our hit_button and stick_button.
    #   This ensures that they will be put in the exact same place as the previous buttons.

    # This method simply calls the hit method over on our game_state instance which deals with the game logic side of the player receiving a card.

    # If they instead click the stick_button, we will do the following:

    # We can then pass this over to display_table in order to draw it on the screen.
    # We also pass False to the hide_dealer argument in order to show the player what the dealer had in their hand.

    # The show_gameplay_buttons method just does what our show_play_again_options method did but in reverse.
    # Instead of forgetting the hit and stick buttons, it forgets the quit and play again buttons and re-packs the hit and stick buttons
    # in their place.
    #
    # This is all that is needed in order to have our game function. Now we just need to piece it together.
